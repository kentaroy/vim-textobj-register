==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*textobj-register-introduction*

*textobj-register* is a Vim plugin to provide text objects to select a 
pattern from register. 

For example, if the content of the register as folows:
>
	    --- Registers ---

	    "" unnamed
	    "0 reg0
	    "1 reg1
	        :
	        :
	    "a rega
	        :
	        :

|<Plug>(textobj-register-i)| will select a pattern in unnamed register. 
In this case, "unnamed" in the current buffer is selected.

On the other hand, |<Plug>(textobj-register-a)| will take an additional key to
be a "register name". If |<Plug>(textobj-register-a)| is followed by "1", 
pattern from the first register ("reg1", in this case) is selected.

This plugin is especially useful when invoked after vim-operator-replace
(https://github.com/kana/vim-operator-replace). Suppose the following case
(">" is the cursor position),
>
		\begin{center}
		    >to be replaced
		\end{center}

where you want to replace the indented text with non-indented text with
operator-replace. This results in
>
		\begin{center}
		replaced text one
		replaced text two
		\end{center}
<
After the operation, you can add indents to the replaced text with ">ir".
There should be another way to achieve it, but *textobj-register* will be the 
most reliable method in this case. After all, you will get
>
		\begin{center}
		    replaced text one
		    replaced text two
		\end{center}
<

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.8 or later (vimscript#2100)

INTERFACE					*textobj-register-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS					*textobj-register-mappings*

These key mappings are defined in Visual mode and Operator-pending mode.

<Plug>(textobj-register-a)			*<Plug>(textobj-register-a)*
			Like |<Plug>(textobj-indent-i)|, but it takes
                        additional key to be the "register name", where the 
                        pattern is taken from.


<Plug>(textobj-register-i)			*<Plug>(textobj-register-i)*
			Select the pattern in unnamed register. 

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*textobj-register-customizing*

				    *g:textobj_register_no_default_key_mappings*
					    *:TextobjRegisterDefaultKeyMappings*
This plugin will define the following key mappings in Visual mode and
Operator-pending mode automatically.  If you don't want these key mappings,
define |g:textobj_register_no_default_key_mappings| before this plugin is loaded
(e.g. in your |vimrc|).  You can also use |:TextobjRegisterDefaultKeyMappings|
to redefine these key mappings.  This command doesn't override existing {lhs}s
unless [!] is given.

	{lhs}	{rhs}			~
	-----	----------------------	~
	ar	<Plug>(textobj-register-a)
	ir	<Plug>(textobj-register-i)
